standup.py — Phase 5: write an honest, per-person daily standup with the LLM.

Takes the matched GitHub+Jira data (match.py) and produces a short standup
grouped by person: what they did (from commits/PRs), the status of their
tickets, and any blockers — with a hard rule that it never invents work and
says plainly when someone was quiet.

People are grouped by first name so a git author ("Rohith") and a Jira
assignee ("Rohith Reddy") land together. PRs are reported at the team level
(GitHub logins don't map cleanly to git/Jira names).

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You write a team's daily standup from real activity data \
(git commits, pull requests, Jira tickets). Be honest and specific.

Hard rules:
- Use ONLY the activity provided. Never invent tasks, progress, or blockers.
- Put blockers / at-risk items FIRST if there are any.
- If a person has little or no activity, say so plainly (e.g. "No tracked
  activity today") — do not pad with filler for people who did nothing.
- For people who DID work, be concrete and detailed: write 3-6 bullets under
  "Did" that name the actual features, files, modules, or areas from their
  commit messages. Prefer specifics ("added the Slack posting module and the
  auto-move-on-merge logic; fixed the GitHub reader to scan all branches")
  over vague summaries ("made progress on several phases"). Group closely
  related commits, but don't collapse real detail into one vague line.

Output (markdown), one block per person:
*<Name>*
• Did:
   - <concrete bullet naming what was built/changed>
   - <another>
   - ... (3-6 for an active person)
• Tickets: <their tickets with status, or "none assigned">
• Blockers: <only if evident from the data, else "None">

End with a one-line *Team* note: open PRs waiting, and anything unassigned
that has activity.
